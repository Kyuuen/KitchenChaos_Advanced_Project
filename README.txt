Hey there, this project is the first time I try with a 3D game. 
So I've decided to follow a tutorial on Youtube. You can find the course at this link: https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg?si=kc676OZ2Om6Z8iGL

I'm also adding some cool features there. Make sure to explore my version and leave a comment.
Enjoy the game.
